# Probabilistic FastText for Multi-Sense Word Embeddings
This repository contains the implementation of the models in *[Athiwaratkun et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08424), Probabilistic FastText for Multi-Sense Word Embeddings, ACL 2018*. The paper can be accessed on Arxiv [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02901).

Similar to our previous work in *[Athiwaratkun and Wilson](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08424), Multimodal Word Distributions, ACL 2017*, we represent each word in the dictionary as a Gaussian Mixture distribution that can extract multiple meanings. We use FastText as our subword representation to enhance semantic estimation of rare words or words outside the training vocabulary. 

The BibTeX entry for the paper is:

## 0. What's in this Library?

We provide 

**(1)** scripts to train the multi-sense FastText embeddings. We give instructions on how to train the model in **1**. 

**(2)** Python scripts to evaluate the trained models on word similarity in **2**. Our scripts allows the subword model to be loaded directly into a Python object which can be used to other tasks. 
   
**(3)** pre-trained model and evaluation script in **3.** This section includes intructions on how to load a pre-trained FastText model (single sense) into our format which allows loading as Python object. 


## 1. Train

1.1 Compile the C++ files. The step requires a compiler with C++11 support such as g++-4.7.2 or newer or clang-3.3 or newer. It also requires **make** which can be installed via ``sudo apt-get install build-essential`` on Ubuntu. 

Once you have **make** and a C++ compiler, you can compile our code by executing:
```
make
```
This command will generate *multift*, an executable of our model. 

1.2 Obtain text data for training. We included scripts to download **text8** and **text9** in **data/**.
```
bash data/get_text8.sh
bash data/get_text9.sh
```
In our paper, we use the concatenation of *ukWaC* and *WaCkypedia_EN* as our English text corpus. Both datasets can be requested [here](http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php?id=download).

The foreign language datasets *deWac* (German), *itWac* (Italian), and *frWac* (French) can be requested using the above link as well. 

1.3 Run sample training scripts for *text8* or *text9*.

```
bash exps/train_text8_multi.sh
```

After the training is complete, the following files will be saved:

```
modelname.words         List of words in the dictionary
modelname.bin           A binary file for the subword embedding model
modelname.in            The subword embeddings
modelname.in2           The embeddings for the second Gaussian component.
modelname.subword       The final representation of words in the dictionary. Note that the representation for words outside the dictionary can be computed using the provided python module based on the files *.in and *.in2.
```

## 2. Evaluate

2.1 The provided python module **multift.py** can be used to load the multisense FT object. 

```
ft = multift.MultiFastText(basename="modelfiles/modelname", multi=True)
```
Note that the first time it loads the model can be quite slow. However, it saves the **.npy** files for later use which allows the loading to be much faster. 

We can query for nearest neighbors give a word or evaluate the embeddings against word similarity datasets. 

2.2 The script **eval/eval_model_wordsim.py** calculates the Spearman's correlation for multiple word similarity datasets given a model. We provide examples below.

```
python eval/eval_model_wordsim.py --modelname modelfiles/multi_text8_e10_d300_vs2e-4_lr1e-5_margin1 | tee log/eval_wordsim_text8.txt
python eval/eval_model_wordsim.py --modelname modelfiles/multi_text9_e10_d300_vs2e-4_lr1e-5_margin1 | tee log/eval_wordsim_text9.txt
```

Sample output of the text8. *sub* and *sub2* correspond to the Spearman's correlation of the first and second Gaussian components. We can see that having two components with potentially disentangled meanings improve the Spearman's correlation for word similarity. 

Below is the output for word similarity evaluation on *text8*.
```

```

A sample script **eval/eval_text9_model_nn.py** show the nearest neighbors of words such as *rock*, *star*, and *cell* where we observe multiple meanings for each word.
```
python eval/eval_text9_model_nn.py | tee log/eval_text9_model_nn.txt
```
```
Nearest Neighbors for rock, cluster 0
Top highest similarity of rock cl 0
['rock,:0', ..., 'bedrock:0', 'rocky:0', 'rocks,:0', '[[rock:0', ...

Nearest Neighbors for rock, cluster 1
Top highest similarity of rock cl 1
['(band)]],:0', '(band)]]:0', 'songwriters:0', 'songwriter,:0', 'songwriter:0', ...
```


## 3. Loading and Analyzing Pre-Trained Models

We provide a pre-trained English model in *.tar.7z* and *.zip* format.

1. **7z** option (15 GB download, long extraction time). The *.tar.7z* file contails *.npy* files of vectors and *.words* for the dictionary file.
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/probabilistic-ft-multisense/multift-english/mv-wacky_e10_d300_vs2e-4_lr1e-5_mar1.tar.7z -P modelfiles/
cd modelfiles
7z x -so mv-wacky_e10_d300_vs2e-4_lr1e-5_mar1.tar.7z | tar xf - -C .
cd ..
```
2. **.zip** option (30 GB, faster extraction time).
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/probabilistic-ft-multisense/multift-english/mv-wacky_e10_d300_vs2e-4_lr1e-5_mar1.zip -P modelfiles/
cd modelfiles
unzip mv-wacky_e10_d300_vs2e-4_lr1e-5_mar1.zip
cd ..
```

### 3.1 Replicating our paper's results

### 3.2 Analyze FastText Objects in Python

FastText (www.fasttext.cc) provide model files in two formats: *.bin* and *.vec*. Note that the model based on *.bin* can calculate the representation for any given word that might not be in the directionary. This has the advantage over using *.vec* files which contains pre-calculated vectors of words in the training dictionary. 

We additionally provide a functionality to convert the *.bin* FastText objects to our format, which can then be loaded into a Python object using *multift.py*.

One can convert a *.bin* file into our format via:
```
./multift output-model -multi 0 modelfiles/downloaded_model.bin 
```
The model in our format will be saved in **modelfiles/downloaded_model.in**, **modelfiles/downloaded_model.out**, etc. This model can be loaded with our Python script using:
```
ft = multift.MultiFastText(basename=modelfiles/downloaded_model, multi=False)
```
Note that the above two steps will generate extra *.npy* files which allow for much faster loading at subsequent times. 

#### Evaluating FastText

The following script downloads the Wiki English embeddings from www.fasttext.cc, converts it to the python-readable format, and evaluate it on word similarity datasets.

```
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fasttext-vectors/wiki.en.zip -P modelfiles/
cd modelfiles
unzip wiki.en.zip
cd ..
./multift output-model -multi 0 modelfiles/wiki.en.bin
python eval/eval_model_wordsim.py --modelname modelfiles/wiki.en --multi 0 | tee log/eval_wordsim_ft_wiki-eng.txt
```
Output:
```
   Dataset  modelfiles/wiki.en-sub
0       SL               38.033168
