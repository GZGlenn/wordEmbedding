# Word2GM (Word to Gaussian Mixture)

This is an implementation of the model in *[Athiwaratkun and Wilson](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08424), Multimodal Word Distributions, ACL 2017*.

We represent each word in the dictionary as a Gaussian Mixture distribution and train it using a max-margin objective based on expected likelihood kernel energy function.

## Updates
Feb 27 2018: We updated the code to be compatible with tensorflow 1.0+. Training on large datasets also no longer need tf installation from source. In this version, we provide modified skipgram c ops to handle large dataset training. 

## Dependencies
This code is tested on Tensorflow 1.5.0. The code should be compatible with Tensorflow 1.0 and above. 

Note:This repository was previously compatible with Tensorflow 0.12 but the support for pre tf1.0 will not be maintained. However, you can access it at this [commit](https://github.com/benathi/word2gm/tree/90a3f50cb66d4f863eed90913bc31dbdd8064fd4).

For plotting, we use [ggplot](https://github.com/yhat/ggplot.git)
```
pip install -U ggplot
# or 
conda install -c conda-forge ggplot
# or
pip install git+https://github.com/yhat/ggplot.git
```

## Training Data
The data used in the paper is the concatenation of *ukWaC* and *WaCkypedia_EN*, both of which can be requested [here](http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php?id=download).

We include a script **get_text8.sh** to download a small dataset **text8** which can be used to train word embeddings. We note that we can observe the polysemies behaviour even on a small dataset such as text8. That is, some word such as 'rock' has one Gaussian component being close to 'jazz', 'pop', 'blue' and another Gaussian component close to 'stone', 'sediment', 'basalt', etc.


## Training

For text8, the training script with the proper hyperparameters are in **train_text8.sh**

For UKWAC+Wackypedia, the training script **train_wac.sh** contains our command to replicate the results.


## Steps
Below are the steps for training and visualization with text8 dataset.

0. Compile C skipgram module for tensorflow training. This generates word2vec_ops.so file which we will use when we import this module in the python code. Note that this version of the code supports training on large datasets without compiling the entire Tensorflow library from source (unlike in the previous version of our code).
```
chmod +x compile_skipgram_ops.sh
./compile_skipgram_ops.sh
```

1. Obtain the dataset and train.
```
bash get_text8.sh
python word2gm_trainer.py --num_mixtures 2 --train_data data/text8 --spherical --embedding_size 50 --epochs_to_train 10 --var_scale 0.05 --save_path modelfiles/t8-2s-e10-v05-lr05d-mc100-ss5-nwout-adg-win10 --learning_rate 0.05  --subsample 1e-5 --adagrad  --min_count 5 --batch_size 128 --max_to_keep 100 --checkpoint_interval 500 --window_size 10
# or simply calling ./train_text8.sh
```
See at the end of page for details on training options.

2. Note that the model will be saved at modelfiles/t8-2s-e10-v05-lr05d-mc100-ss5-nwout-adg-win10. The code to analyze the model and visualize the results is in **Analyze Text8 Model.ipynb**. See model API below.


3. We can visualize the word embeddings itself by executing the following command in iPynb:
```
w2gm_text8_2s.visualize_embeddings()
```
This command prepares the word embeddings to be visualized by Tensorflow's Tensorboard. Once the embeddings are prepared, the visualization can be done by shell command:
```
tensorboard --logdir=modelfiles/t8-2s-e10-v05-lr05d-mc100-ss5-nwout-adg-win10_emb --port=6006
```
Then, navigate the browser to (http://localhost/6006) (or a url of the appropriate machine that has the model) and click at the **Embeddings** tab. Note that the **logdir** folder is the "**original-folder**" + "_emb".

## Visualization
The Tensorboard embeddings visualization tools (please use Firefox or Chrome) allow for nearest neighbors query, in addition to PCA and t-sne visualization. We use the following notation: *x:i* refers to the *i*th mixture component of word 'x'. For instance, querying for 'bank:0' yields 'river:1', 'confluence:0', 'waterway:1' as the nearest neighbors, which means that this component of 'bank' corresponds to river bank. On the other hand, querying for 'bank:1' gives the nearest neighbors 'banking:1', 'banker:0', 'ATM:0', which indicates that this component of 'bank' corresponds to financial bank.


We provide visualization (compatible with Chrome and Firefox) for our models trained on *ukWaC+WaCkypedia* for [K=1](http://35.161.153.223:6001), [K=2](http://35.161.153.223:6002), and [K=3](http://35.161.153.223:6003).


## Trained Model
We provide a trained model for K=2 [here](http://35.161.153.223:6004/w2gm-k2-d50.tar.gz). To analyze the model, see **Analyze Model.ipynb**. The code expects the model to be extracted to directory **modelfiles/w2gm-k2-d50/**.
